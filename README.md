# PillBot
Autonomous pill-dispensing robot built using a LEGO EV3 kit and programmed using C++/RobotC
The main idea of the project is to build an automated pill dispenser that reads information from a file and
dispenses a certain number of pills at different times throughout the day. There have been several designs
of the dispenser to accommodate the requirements of the project. The final design includes three pill
containers and three motors with trapdoors connected to them. The trapdoors are what allow the pills to
be dispensed onto a ramp leading to a cup for the user. There is also a linear slider with a color sensor
attached to it responsible for detecting the level of the pills to know if any of the containers are running
out of pills. The program used to run this pill dispenser consists of eight different functions with different
parameters and return types. These functions are what ensure that the pill dispenser is functional and
responsive to the user. The only issue with the pill dispenser is the accuracy of the pill dispensing as the
mechanical design used to dispense the pills does not guarantee the dispensing of a single pill. This means
that the number of pills dispensed will almost never be equal to the number of pills meant to be dispensed
as per the text file. The conclusion of the project would be the redesign of the mechanical part to ensure
that a singular pill is dispensed every time and the complete pill dispenser is functional enough to
broadcasted onto an industrial scope.
